Predicting the success of a mobile game is a prime issue in game industry. Thousands
of games are being released each day. However, a few of them succeed while the
majority fail. Towards the goal of investigating the potential correlation between the
success of a mobile game and its specific attributes, this work was conducted. More
than 17 thousand games were considered for that reason. We show that IAPs (In-App
Purchases), genre, number of supported languages, developer profile and release
month have a clear effect on the success of a mobile game. We also develop a novel
success score reflecting multiple objectives. Furthermore, we show that game icons
with certain visual characteristics tend to be associated with more rating counts. We
employ different machine learning models to predict a novel success score metric of a
mobile game given its attributes. The trained models were able to predict this score, as
well as the expected rating average and rating count for a mobile game with 70%
accuracy.
