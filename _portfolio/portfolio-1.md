A sample panorama displaying procedurally generated humans by the NOVA framework in a controllable, configurable environment along with their annotations. The first half is photorealistic renderings transitioning between different times of day and the latter half is demonstrating some of the pixel-level annotations NOVA generates for use in various computer vision tasks: (from left to right) instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, optical flow, surface normals and the depth data.
