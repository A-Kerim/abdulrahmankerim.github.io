On the first half, sample frames from the currently-available real (top-left quarter) (MOT, NUS-PRO, OTB-100, and TC128) and synthetic (bottom-left quarter)
(VIPER, PHAV, Synthia, and Virtual KITTI) visual object tracking datasets demonstrate the lack of adverse weather conditions. The second half presents sample
frames from sequences spanning raining, foggy and snowy weather conditions from PTAW172Real (top-right quarter) and PTAW217Synth (bottom-right quarter) datasets
that we introduce in this work.
