title: "Using Synthetic Data for Person Tracking Under Adverse Weather Conditions"
excerpt: "We introduce a novel person tracking dataset of synthetic sequences (PTAW217Synth) procedurally generated by our NOVA-Extended framework spanning the same weather conditions in varying severity to mitigate the problem of data scarcity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performances of the state-of-the-art deep trackers under adverse weather conditions can be boosted when the available real training sequences are complemented with our synthetically generated dataset during training.<br/>

On the first half, sample frames from the currently-available real (top-left quarter) (MOT, NUS-PRO, OTB-100, and TC128) and synthetic (bottom-left quarter)
(VIPER, PHAV, Synthia, and Virtual KITTI) visual object tracking datasets demonstrate the lack of adverse weather conditions. The second half presents sample
frames from sequences spanning raining, foggy and snowy weather conditions from PTAW172Real (top-right quarter) and PTAW217Synth (bottom-right quarter) datasets
that we introduce in this work.
