I am currently a full-time lecturer at UCA and a researcher at the School of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University, United Kingdom.

In my research, I address the limitations of computer vision models under challenging scenarios, such as adverse weather conditions and low illumination. I propose using game engines to generate rich and diverse synthetic datasets as a solution. At the same time, I develop novel synthetic-aware computer vision models. I focus specifically on Visual Object Tracking, Semantic Segmentation, and Video Stabilization.
