<p align= "justify">

I am currently a full-time lecturer at UCA and a researcher at the School of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University,
United Kingdom.

</p>

<p align= "justify">

I specialize in addressing computer vision models limitations in adverse conditions through game engine-generated synthetic datasets.
My research focuses on developing novel synthetic-aware models for Visual Object Tracking, Semantic Segmentation, and
Video Stabilization. I aim to revolutionize computer vision by bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world data, 
driving advancements in autonomous systems, surveillance, and robotics. Seeking opportunities to contribute my expertise to 
cutting-edge organizations passionate about innovative research in computer vision.
