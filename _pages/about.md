I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science in the School of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University, United Kingdom. I am under the supervision of [Leandro S. Marcolino](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lira/people/leandro-soriano-marcolino) and [Richard Jiang](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/richard-jiang). I received my MSc degree in Computer Engineering from Hacettepe Univeresity in 2021, my first BSc degree in Computer Engineering from Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University (AYBU) in 2018, and second BSc degree from the same school in Electronics and Communications Engineering in 2017.

In my research, I address the limitations of computer vision models under challenging scenarios, such as adverse weather conditions and low illumination. I propose using game engines to generate rich and diverse synthetic datasets as a solution. At the same time, I develop novel synthetic-aware computer vision models. I focus specifically on Visual Object Tracking, Semantic Segmentation, and Video Stabilization.
