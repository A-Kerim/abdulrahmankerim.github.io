From my little experience as a student in different universities in the Middle East and Europe, the main observations I clearly see are the following:
1. We teach our students (in the Middle East) to work individually. However, they teach them to work as groups. They teach them how to communicate with each other but we frankly do not value this at all.
2. The best schools in our countries are shadows and will never reach their western competitors with the current mentality, irresponsibility, and lack of a motivating environment.
3. The activities, clubs, conferences, and social life are limited if not absent.
4. Most of our schools try to imitate the western ones and we always fail to imitate them or to create our own identity. 
5. The money we claim to invest in research is "funny". In some western schools, their budget for research is more than some country's total budget for few years. 
6. The quality of students and lecturers does not change that much. I see no difference at all.
7. Our schools are isolated from the industry. I am really sad to see that they teach outdated technologies, concepts, problems, and solutions.
