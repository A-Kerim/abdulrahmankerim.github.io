In the last three weeks, I have participated in a workshop about presentation skills by Dr. Helen Hargreaves and Dr. Ruth Byrne from Learning Development, Lancaster University. In this spirit, let me reflect on a few aspects of what I learned:
1. Understand your audience. 
2. Make your presentation attractive and grab your audience's attention from the first moment you start.
3. Avoid too much text and use more visually appealing content.
4. Practice, practice, and practice.
5. Mind your voice and body language.
6. Try to engage with your audience.
7. Watch other presenters and pay attention to their presentation skills.
