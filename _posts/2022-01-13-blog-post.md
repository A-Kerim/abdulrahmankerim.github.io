My suggestions to all new Ph.D. students:
1) DO NOT allow anyone to select your Ph.D. topic. It is a serious thing. You will stay with it for at least three years.
2) Do not select your supervisor randomly. I think a great deal of your Ph.D. is related to your relationship with your supervisor/s.
3) Get in touch with your Lab's friends and discuss with them your ideas. "Two heads are better than one"!
4) Publish, publish, publish... :)
5) Try to participate in conferences, seminars, lectures, and so on.
6) Ask people to read and comment on your work.
7) Force your self to have at least one meeting with your supervisor weekly.
8) Write down your progress and be organized.
9) Enjoy your time. Remember it is a great thing that you are helping humanity with your research.
