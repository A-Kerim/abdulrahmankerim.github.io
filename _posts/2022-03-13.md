I feel guilty...I feel guilty to see other people suffer while being unable to help them!
As a researcher/engineer/student, I see a lot of problems that can be easily solved using AI. How many people can see/hear/walk/talk again if just we worked harder? If just we increased the research budget further? If we just thought as humans! How many lives can be saved?
Well, we can reduce car accidents, suicide rates, improve pharmaceutical solutions...etc It is a shame to see that some wonderful researches are not funded because of a limited budget but you see funding is open for entertainment, TV show, and movies!
Nowadays, our children wanna be Youtubers, singers, and actors but not researchers. Everyone wants to be performing on the stage and no one wants to be in the lab! Surprisingly, when a pandemic occurs, or catastrophe happens, we start to fund and support relevant research...I hope that on time it will not be too late!
