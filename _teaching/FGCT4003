Board Game Design (UCA website)
Applying your skills to paper-based design, you’ll work in teams to prototype and build a board game. You’ll consider building mechanics, technical design
documentation and artwork such as box art, character and environment designs, including 3D models for your game, which you’ll present at the end.

Samples works will be shared here soon!
