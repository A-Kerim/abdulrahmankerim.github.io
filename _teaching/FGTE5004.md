### Overview:
The FGTE5004 Games Systems Design unit undertaken during year 2 is focused on the
continued development of core programming skills learned throughout year 1.
The unit itself will be divided into three individual briefs each designed to aid in the
development of further programming skills and the abilities required to design core game
systems. This unit runs through the entire course of year 2.
In contrast to the year 1 programming unit, Game Systems Design is focussed not only on
Unreal, Blueprint and C++ but also will highlight examples from Unity and C#.
Beyond this you will be introduced to a wider variety of programming practices, data
structures and design patterns.

**Learning Outcomes:**
<ul>
 <li>LO1: Demonstrate knowledge of digital systems and programming skills.</li>
 <li>LO2: Demonstrate understanding through application of C++.</li>
 <li>LO3: Demonstrate problem solving and creative approaches specific to game design.</li>
 <li>LO4: Demonstrate self-direction and effective time-management.</li>
