### Overview:
Building on the fundamentals of game development gained in term 1, this 
unit introduces further key concepts required to more effectively prototype 
and produce compelling video games. You will also resume your 
education in the critical and contextual debates surrounding the medium 
of video games.
Exploring the principals of Game and Level design, introducing you to a 
variety of design methodologies and development techniques that will 
enable you to swiftly block out levels and create mechanically sound 
gameplay experiences, considering the playerâ€™s journey and experience.
In conjunction with design and asset workflows you will be introduced to 
an industry standard programming language such as C++ for video 
games. Your technical proficiency as a gameplay programmer will be 
developed further, expanding on the knowledge gained in term 1.
